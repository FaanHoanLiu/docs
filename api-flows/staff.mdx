# Staff API Flow

Describes the journey of a staff member ('expeditor') in the Kitchen Display System.

## Order Display

After the patron places an order, the order appears on the expeditor's KDS. At this stage, the expeditor is only interested in seeing new orders.

### Request

The client needs to fetch all new orders on the current day using the `orders` endpoint. The client filters the response, including only the orders with a status of `Received` for the current day:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/orders?filter=status.eq~Received|created_at.gte~2025-05-01'
```

### Response

The server returns a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing new orders.

Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "6828b99cd306cfcdcf20b0e1",
      "name": "Jeremy",
      "table_number": 20,
      "status": "Received",
      "priority": 3,
      "dish_ids": [
        "6828b91dd306cfcdcf20b0d7"
      ],
      "special_requests": "No peanuts.",
      "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
      "scheduled_at": null
    }  ],
  "total_results": 1
}
```

## Prioritization

The expeditor can adjust the priority of the order (from 1 to 5), increasing the priority to 1 for orders that require immediate attention.

### Request

To allow the expeditor to change a dish's priority, it uses the `orders` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://{serverUrl}/orders/{id}'
```

The request body contains the JSON for the order resource with the priority modified:

```json
{
  "id": "6828b99cd306cfcdcf20b0e1",
  "name": "Jeremy",
  "table_number": 20,
  "status": "Received",
  "priority": 1,
  "dish_ids": [
    "6828b91dd306cfcdcf20b0d7"
  ],
  "special_requests": "No peanuts.",
  "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
  "scheduled_at": null
}
```

### Response

The server responds with a ```200 OK``` status code with the response body containing the updated resource.

## Initiating Preparation

Now that a dish is prioritized, the expeditor can initiate the preparation of the order by settingthe order status to `In Progress`

### Request

To do this, the client uses the `orders` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://{serverUrl}/orders/{id}'
```

The request body contains the JSON for the order resource with the `status` modified from `Received` to `In Progress`.

### Response

The server responds with a `200  OK` status code with the response body containing the updated order resource.

## Order Prepration by Stations

Each dish in the order is assigned to a specific station (e.g. cold, hot, beverages). Stations responsible for each dish see their respective parts of the order on their KDS.

### Request

To do this, the client needs to use the `dishes` endpoint to view an order's dishes, filtering the response to only include dishes belonging to a specific `station`:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/orders/{id}/dishes?filter=station.eq~hot&fields=name|image_name'
```

### Response

The server returns a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing all the dishes part of the order that belong to the specified station:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "6828b91dd306cfcdcf20b0d7",
      "name": "Pappardelle al Cinghiale",
      "image_name": "pappardelle_al_cinghiale"
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 1
}
```

## Display Dish Ingredients

When staff begins preparing dishes at their station, they need to know each dish's ingredients.

### Request

To display a dish's ingredients, the client uses the `dishes` endpoint with the ingredients sub-resource. The client references previously saved dish IDs and sends an HTTP request for each:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes/{id}/ingredients'
```

### Response

The server responds with a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing a list of a dish's ingredients.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "6828b624d306cfcdcf20b0c8",
      "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:15:32.264Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:15:32.265Z",
      "name": "Wild Boar",
      "in_stock_qty": 3,
      "price": 5000
    },
    {
      "id": "6828b716d306cfcdcf20b0cc",
      "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:19:34.273Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:19:34.273Z",
      "name": "Juniper Berries",
      "in_stock_qty": 15,
      "price": 1200
    },
    {
      "id": "6828b763d306cfcdcf20b0d0",
      "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:20:51.004Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:20:51.004Z",
      "name": "Sage",
      "in_stock_qty": 20,
      "price": 800
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 3
}
```

The client can now display the list of ingredients required to create a dish.

## Ready For Assembly

When a station completes preparation of their part of the order, they mark it as "Ready For Assembly" on their KDS. The expeditor is notified when all stations have marked their parts as ready. This process is managed within the client's logic and doesn't require use of the API.

## Order Assembly

The expeditor assembles the parts of the order from different stations. Once assembled, the expeditor updates the order status to "On The Way".

### Request

To do this, the client needs to update the order status, once again, using the `orders` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://{serverUrl}/orders/{id}'
```

For table-side ordering, the client sends an HTTP request, updating the `status` of the order from `In Progress` to `On The Way`.

### Response

The server responds with a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing the updated order resource.

````json
{
  "id": "6828b99cd306cfcdcf20b0e1",
  "name": "Jeremy",
  "table_number": 20,
  "status": "On The Way",
  "priority": 1,
  "dish_ids": [
    "6828b91dd306cfcdcf20b0d7"
  ],
  "special_requests": "No peanuts.",
  "created_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-05-17T16:30:20.565Z",
  "scheduled_at": null
}```

For takeaway orders, the expeditor changes the ```status``` to ```Ready for Pickup``` to indicate the order is ready for the patron.
