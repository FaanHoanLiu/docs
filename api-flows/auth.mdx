# Authorization API Flow

## Account creation

The user must create an application-specific account to access protected endpoints. The client app must send an HTTP request to the `users` endpoint to create a user account using the form information submitted by the user.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://{serverUrl}/users'
```

including the user account details and basic authentication:

```json
{
    "grant_type": "password",
    "user_name" : "johndoe",
    "password": "pl@intextp@$$word"
}
```

### Response

If successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code with the response body containing the new user resource:

```json
{
    "user_name" : "johndoe",
    "user_id" : "662948b2a4475a2423adjab0c8",
    "created_at" : "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at" : "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Admin login

Next, the admin needs to log into the admin portal. To send requests to admin endpoints, the client app requires an access token. This is obtained by making a POST request to the `/auth/token` endpoint.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request including a basic authorization header and the user's details. The authorization header includes a base64-encoded client ID and client secret that the server uses to authenticate the client app. Once authorized, the server will exchange the user's username and password for an access token. The `grant_type' field instructs the endpoint to perform the resource owner password credential flow.

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://{serverUrl}/auth/token'
```

```json
{
  "grant_type": "password",
  "user_name": "johndoe",
  "password" : "pl@intextp@$$word"
}
```

### Response

Successful requests return a `201 Created` status with an access token in the response. The access token is a UUID used for authentication. The `expires_in` field indicates the token's validity period. Use the `refresh_token` to obtain a new access token after expiration; it lasts longer than the access token. The `token_type` field specifies usage; include the access token as a bearer token in the authorization headre for protected requests.

Example response

```json
{
    "created_at": "2025-06-22T16:42:14.124Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-06-22T16:42:14.124Z",
    "access_token": "b9606625-9ac3-4210-b237-eae43d937e7d",
    "expires_at": "2025-06-22T17:12:14.124Z",
    "refresh_token": "fc88df0e-9d67-4fc4-b0ff-dbec6e009455",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user_name": "apiuser01",
    "_id": "68583266e9068b612272c79c",
    "__v": 0
}
```

## Refreshing the Access Token

After a client sends an HTTP request to a protected endpoint, the server may return a `401 Unauthorized` status code, indicating the expired access token.  To refresh the access token, the client needs to send an HTTP request to the `/auth/refresh-token` endpoint.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://{serverUrl}/auth/refresh-token'
```

The client sends an HTTP request, this time including the refresh token in the authorization header instead of the expired access token:

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code with the response body containing a new access and refresh token.

Example response

```json
{
    "_id": "68583266e9068b612272c79c",
    "created_at": "2025-06-22T16:47:24.086Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-06-22T16:47:24.086Z",
    "access_token": "14b5d770-d64f-4260-9401-eac2334a8492",
    "expires_at": "2025-06-22T17:17:24.086Z",
    "refresh_token": "2c26bc1b-9fde-4810-b1b2-b22ba7dbe0f5",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user_name": "apiuser01",
    "__v": 0
}
```

The client application updates the access and refresh tokens locally so they can be easily retrieved. The client resumes including the access token in HTTP requests to protected endpoints.
